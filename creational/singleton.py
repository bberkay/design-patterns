    Creational Design Pattern
    -------------------------
    Creational design patterns are a category of software design patterns that focus on object creation mechanisms.
    These patterns provide solutions to various object creation problems and help ensure that objects are created in a
    flexible, reusable, and efficient manner. Creational design patterns address the process of object instantiation,
    hiding the complexity of object creation, and promoting loose coupling between objects.

    Singleton
    ---------
    This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
    It is useful when you need to restrict the instantiation of a class to a single object,
    such as a logging or database connection class.
