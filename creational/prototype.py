    Prototype Pattern
    -----------------
    This pattern involves creating a copy or clone of an existing object instead of creating new instances.
    It allows you to create new objects by cloning existing ones, which can be more efficient than creating
    objects from scratch, especially when the object creation is complex or resource-intensive.
