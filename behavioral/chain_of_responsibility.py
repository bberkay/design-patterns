    Behavioral Design Pattern
    -------------------------
    Behavioral design patterns define the communication and interaction between objects or
    components in a software system, enabling flexible and reusable solutions for managing
    complex behaviors and interactions. They encompass patterns like Observer, Strategy,
    Command, and Iterator, providing strategies for organizing and coordinating software
    component behavior effectively.

    Chain of Responsibility
    -----------------------
    Chain of Responsibility is a design pattern that allows objects to handle a request sequentially
    until it finds a suitable handler. It promotes loose coupling and flexibility in handling requests.
