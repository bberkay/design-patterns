    Observer
    --------
    The Observer design pattern establishes a one-to-many relationship between objects,
    allowing them to communicate and stay updated. It consists of a Subject that notifies
    its Observers of any state changes. This pattern promotes loose coupling and enables
    dynamic subscription and unsubscription of Observers. It facilitates event-driven systems
    and separates the logic of the Subject from the Observers.
