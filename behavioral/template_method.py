    Template Method
    ---------------
    The Template Method design pattern defines the basic structure of an algorithm
    in a base class, while allowing subclasses to customize specific steps. It promotes
    code reuse and flexibility by providing a template for the algorithm, with predefined
    steps and customizable implementations. This pattern ensures consistent behavior across
    different subclasses while allowing for variations in specific parts of the algorithm.
