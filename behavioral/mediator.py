    Mediator
    --------
    The mediator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that promotes loose coupling between components
    by introducing a mediator object that encapsulates the communication logic between them. It allows
    multiple objects, called colleagues, to interact with each other indirectly through the mediator,
    instead of directly communicating with one another. This pattern enhances maintainability and
    flexibility, as it centralizes the control and coordination of interactions, enabling easier
    modifications or extensions to the system.
