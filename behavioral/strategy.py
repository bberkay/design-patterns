    Strategy
    --------
    The Strategy design pattern allows for runtime selection of different
    algorithms or behaviors by encapsulating them in interchangeable objects.
    It promotes flexibility and modularity by separating the implementation
    details from the client code, enabling easy modification or extension of
    an object's behavior without affecting the system's structure.
