    Visitor
    -------
    The Visitor design pattern allows adding new operations to a group of
    related objects without modifying their individual classes. It separates
    the behavior from the objects by introducing a visitor object that visits
    and performs operations on the objects. This promotes extensibility and
    follows the Open-Closed Principle by allowing new behaviors to be added
    without modifying existing code.
