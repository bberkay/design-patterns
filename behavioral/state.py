    State
    -----
    The State design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows an object to alter
    its behavior when its internal state changes. It enables an object to encapsulate
    different behaviors based on its internal state and simplifies the management of
    complex state transitions. The pattern involves defining a set of states as separate
    classes, each representing a specific behavior, and allowing the object to transition
    between these states based on certain conditions. By using the State pattern, the
    object's behavior can vary dynamically without the need for numerous conditional
    statements, resulting in a more flexible and maintainable design.
