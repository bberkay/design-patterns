    Flyweight Pattern
    -----------------
    The Flyweight design pattern is a structural design pattern that focuses on
    minimizing the memory usage and improving performance by sharing common data
    among multiple objects. It is used when there is a large number of similar
    objects that can be effectively managed by sharing certain intrinsic state
    between them.
