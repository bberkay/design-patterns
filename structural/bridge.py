    Bridge
    -------
    The main idea behind the Bridge pattern is to separate the abstract representation of a class or
    object from its implementation details. It allows the abstraction and the implementation to be modified
    independently without affecting each other. This promotes flexibility, extensibility, and maintenance
    of the codebase.
