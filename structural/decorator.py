"""
    Decorator pattern
    -----------------
    The decorator class contains a reference to the original object and enhances its
    behavior by adding new functionality before or after delegating to the original
    object's methods. This way, the decorator class acts as a transparent wrapper,
    extending the behavior of the original object without modifying its code.
