    Structural Design Pattern
    -------------------------
    Structural design patterns are a category of design patterns in software engineering. These patterns
    focus on organizing classes and objects to form larger structures and provide solutions for building
    flexible and efficient software systems. They address the composition of classes and objects to create
    larger structures while keeping the system flexible, maintainable, and reusable.

    Adapter
    -------
    This pattern allows incompatible classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into
    another expected by the clients. It is useful when you want to use a class that does not have the interface
    you need. It also allows you to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes
    with incompatible interfaces.
